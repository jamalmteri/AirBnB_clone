AirBnB Clone - The Console



Console
The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of AirBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

Using the Console:

The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:

$ ./console.py
While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
To quit the console, enter the command quit, or input an EOF signal (ctrl-D).

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
